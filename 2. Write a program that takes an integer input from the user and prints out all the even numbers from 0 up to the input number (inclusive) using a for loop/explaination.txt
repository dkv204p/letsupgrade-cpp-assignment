Explanation:

1. Declare an integer variable input.
2. Prompt the user to enter an integer.
3. Read the user input into input using the cin operator.
4. Use the cout operator to display a message indicating the even numbers to be printed.
5. Use a for loop to iterate from 0 up to and including input. The loop variable i is initialized to 0, and on each iteration, it is incremented by 1.
6. Use an if statement to check if i is even. If it is, use the cout operator to print i.
7. Return 0 to indicate that the program has finished executing.
